### **Note to future vince/disclaimer to anyone else:**  
  
update.sh will only work if you have:  
    + write permission on the master branch of the containing repo
    + the same (fairy vanilla) local file structure that it looks for. 

It is not intended for use by anyone other than myself (for now) and 
no guarantee is made that it will function properly for anyone. That said, feel
free to manipulate it to your heart's content.

When moving to a new machine you'll have to move things into place, or run the
landing script if you like the (fairly vanilla) setup and it will create/move 
things for you.
