**Note to future vince/anyone else:** update.sh will only work for you if you 
fork first (or copy it into your own repo) and have the same local file 
structure. It is not intended for use by anyone other than myself (for now) and 
no guarantee is made that it will function properly for anyone.

When moving to a new machine you'll have to move things into place, or run the
landing script if you like the setup and it will create/move things for you
